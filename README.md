Ethereum 2 Merge Module
=======================
This is a [Kurtosis module][module-docs] that will:

1. Generate EL & CL genesis information using [this genesis generator](https://github.com/skylenet/ethereum-genesis-generator)
1. Spin up a network of mining Eth1 clients
1. Spin up a network of Eth2 Beacon/validator clients
1. Add [a transaction spammer](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/tx-fuzz) that will repeatedly send transactions to the network
1. Launch [a consensus monitor](https://github.com/ralexstokes/ethereum_consensus_monitor) instance attached to the network
1. Perform the merge
1. Optionally block until the Beacon nodes finalize an epoch (i.e. finalized_epoch > 0 and finalized_epoch = current_epoch - 3)

For much more detailed information about how the merge works in Ethereum testnets, see [this document](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ExXcnR0-SJGthjz1dwkA1A/H1MSKgm3F).

### Quickstart
1. [Install Docker if you haven't done so already][docker-installation]
1. [Install the Kurtosis CLI, or upgrade it to the latest version if it's already installed][kurtosis-cli-installation]
1. Ensure your Docker engine is running:
    ```bash
    docker image ls
    ```
1. Create a file in your home directory `eth2-module-params.json` with the following contents:

    ```javascript
    {
        "logLevel": "info",
    }
    ```

1. Execute the module, passing in the params from the file:
    ```bash
    kurtosis module exec --enclave-id eth2 kurtosistech/eth2-merge-kurtosis-module --execute-params "$(cat ~/eth2-module-params.json)"
    ```

### Management
Kurtosis will create a new enclave to house the services of the Ethereum network. [This page][using-the-cli] contains documentation for managing the created enclave & viewing detailed information about it.

### Configuration
To configure the module behaviour, you can modify your `eth2-module-params.json` file. The full JSON schema that can be passed in is as follows with the defaults provided (though note that the `//` comments are for explanation purposes and aren't valid JSON so need to be removed):

```javascript
{
    // Specification of the participants in the network
    "participants": [
        {
            // The type of EL client that should be started
            // Valid values are "geth", "nethermind", and "besu"
            "elType": "geth",

            // The Docker image that should be used for the EL client; leave blank to use the default for the client type
            // Defaults by client:
            // - geth: parithoshj/geth:merge-876ca42"
            // - nethermind: nethermindeth/nethermind:kiln_0.6
            // - besu: hyperledger/besu:merge
            "elImage": "",

            // The log level string that this participant's EL client should log at
            // If this is emptystring then the global `logLevel` parameter's value will be translated into a string appropriate for the client (e.g. if
            //  global `logLevel` = `info` then Geth would receive `3`, Besu would receive `INFO`, etc.)
            // If this is not emptystring, then this value will override the global `logLevel` setting to allow for fine-grained control
            //  over a specific participant's logging
            "elLogLevel": "",

            // A list of optional extra params that will be passed to the EL client container for modifying its behaviour
            "elExtraParams": [],

            // The type of CL client that should be started
            // Valid values are "nimbus", "lighthouse", "lodestar", "teku", and "prysm"
            "clType": "lighthouse",

            // The Docker image that should be used for the EL client; leave blank to use the default for the client type
            // Defaults by client (note that Prysm is different in that it requires two images - a Beacon and a validator - separated by a comma):
            // - lighthouse: sigp/lighthouse:latest-unstable
            // - teku: consensys/teku:latest
            // - nimbus: statusim/nimbus-eth2:amd64-latest
            // - prysm: prysmaticlabs/prysm-beacon-chain:latest,prysmaticlabs/prysm-validator:latest
            // - lodestar: chainsafe/lodestar:next
            "clImage": "",


            // The log level string that this participant's EL client should log at
            // If this is emptystring then the global `logLevel` parameter's value will be translated into a string appropriate for the client (e.g. if
            //  global `logLevel` = `info` then Teku would receive `INFO`, Prysm would receive `info`, etc.)
            // If this is not emptystring, then this value will override the global `logLevel` setting to allow for fine-grained control
            //  over a specific participant's logging
            "clLogLevel": ""

            // A list of optional extra params that will be passed to the CL client Beacon container for modifying its behaviour
            // If the client combines the Beacon & validator nodes (e.g. Teku, Nimbus), then this list will be passed to the combined Beacon-validator node
            "beaconExtraParams": [],

            // A list of optional extra params that will be passed to the CL client validator container for modifying its behaviour
            // If the client combines the Beacon & validator nodes (e.g. Teku, Nimbus), then this list will also be passed to the combined Beacon-validator node
            "validatorExtraParams": [],
        }
    ],

    // Configuration parameters for the Eth network
    "network": {

	"numValidatorKeysPerNode": 64,

    },

    // If set to false, we won't wait for the EL clients to mine at least 1 block before proceeding with adding the CL clients
    // This is purely for debug purposes; waiting for blockNumber > 0 is required for the CL network to behave as
    //  expected, but that wait can be several minutes. Skipping the wait can be a good way to shorten the debug loop on a
    //  CL client that's failing to start.
    "waitForMining": true,

    // If set, the module will block until a finalized epoch has occurred
    "waitForFinalization": false,

    // The global log level that all clients should log at

### Development
The unit tests in this module also require Kurtosis to be available.
